# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation files from the project's development phases.

### Archived Documentation

These files were used during various stages of development but have been superseded by the current documentation (README.md, METHODOLOGY.md, RESULTS.md):

**Development Guides**:
- `AUTONOMOUS_FLIGHT_GUIDE.md` - Early autonomous flight development
- `MANUAL_CONTROL_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Manual control experiments
- `MANUAL_TRAINING_GUIDE.md` - Manual data collection guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` - Initial deployment planning
- `GETTING_STARTED.md` - Early quickstart (superseded by README.md)
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Another early quickstart version
- `Task1_Drone_Hybrid_RL_PID_Guide.md` - Original project guide

**Hardware Setup**:
- `MOCAP_SETUP.md` - Motion capture system setup (not used)
- `OPTITRACK_SETUP.md` - OptiTrack configuration (not used)
- `REAL_DRONE_GUIDE.md` - Early real drone guide
- `REAL_TASKS.md` - Task list for real drone deployment

**Project Structure**:
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Early structure documentation (superseded by README.md)

**Results**:
- `flight_results.txt` - Early flight test results
- `tuning_results.txt` - PID tuning results

## Current Documentation

The active, up-to-date documentation is in the repository root:

- **README.md**: Main project overview and quick start
- **METHODOLOGY.md**: Detailed methodology and approach
- **RESULTS.md**: Comprehensive results analysis
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: Project management and task tracking

## Why Archived?

These files represent the evolution of the project:
- Multiple iterations of documentation as understanding improved
- Exploration of approaches that were ultimately not used (e.g., motion capture)
- Intermediate planning documents superseded by better organization

They are kept for historical reference and to show the project's development journey.

## Note for Reviewers

If you're evaluating this project, please refer to the **current documentation in the root directory**. These archived files show the iterative development process but may contain outdated or inaccurate information.
